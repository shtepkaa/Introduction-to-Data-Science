In this assignment, you will explore the House Prices data. You will perform initial cleaning, plot some charts and train regression models to predict the price of a house. 
Additionally, you will select the best values of hyperparameters using cross-validation.

For this assignment, you will be submitting a Jupyter notebook. We provide an initial notebook (hw1.ipynb) 
with task statements where you need to fill in the blank cells with your code.
